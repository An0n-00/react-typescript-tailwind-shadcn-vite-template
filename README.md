> [!NOTE]
> Do not forget the following things: `LICENSE`, `README.md`, `package.json`, `index.html`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.

> [!TIP]
> There is a GitHub Actions workflow set up for continuous deployment to GitHub Pages. Update the workflow file in `.github/workflows/cd.yml` if needed. Same goes for continuous integration in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (runs every day at midnight to update dependencies).

### Theming

To change the default theme, edit the `:root {}` and `.dark {}` sections in `src/index.css`. You can copy new theme variables from [ui.shadcn.com/themes](https://ui.shadcn.com/themes).
